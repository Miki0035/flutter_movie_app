Thanks for checking out this flutter mobile app. This was originally suppose to be built
with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) from one of JavaScript Mastery Youtube
channel [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKrX390fJMw) (Shout out to
Adrian 😃 ), but I decided to build the mobile app using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Please
check it out 😮 and let me know what you think.
